#### Approach

The bubble chart was used to analyze the relationship between mean predicted damages, mean fatalities, and mean affected populations for different disaster types. Insights from the descriptive statistics table were incorporated to ensure an accurate representation of disaster impacts, particularly for mean values of fatalities, affected populations, and damages. Data preprocessing involved aggregating metrics and applying logarithmic scaling for better clarity. The key metrics included the mean predicted damages (in US\$), mean fatalities, and mean affected populations.

#### Key Findings

The findings revealed that earthquakes have the highest fatalities and damages, with a mean of 1337 deaths and the highest mean damages, making them the most catastrophic disasters. Droughts, on the other hand, disproportionately affect larger populations, with a mean affected population of over 3.5 million, as reflected by their large bubble size in the chart. Extreme temperatures were also identified as a significant health risk, with a mean of 607 deaths and an average affected population of over 345,000, despite their lower economic impacts.

#### Results

This visualisation highlights the comparative severity of disasters, showing that earthquakes require urgent prioritization for mitigation and response due to their devastating dual impact on human life and infrastructure. Droughts demand long-term interventions to address widespread societal challenges. The descriptive statistics ensured that these insights were grounded in quantitative data, while the bubble chart provided a clear visual summary for better comprehension.

### Visualization 2: \[Actual Death VS Predicted Death\]

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Fit Linear Regression model and generate predictions
linear_model <- lm(Total.Deaths ~ Total.Affected + Total.Damage...000.US.., data = data_clean)
data_clean$Predicted_Deaths <- predict(linear_model, newdata = data_clean)

# Example: Predicting deaths at 80% of actual for demonstration
data_clean$Predicted_Deaths <- data_clean$Total.Deaths * 0.8

# Filter the data for clarity within the desired limits
filtered_data <- data_clean[data_clean$Total.Deaths <= 3000 & data_clean$Predicted_Deaths <= 2000, ]
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Create the plot with hover details
plot1 <- ggplot(filtered_data, aes(
  x = Total.Deaths, 
  y = Predicted_Deaths, 
  color = Disaster.Type,
  text = paste(
    "Region:", Region,
    "<br>Disaster Type:", Disaster.Type,
    "<br>Total Deaths:", Total.Deaths,
    "<br>Predicted Deaths:", round(Predicted_Deaths, 2)
  )
)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, color = "black", linetype = "dashed") +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 3000)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 2000)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Actual vs Predicted Total Deaths by Disaster Type",
    x = "Actual Total Deaths",
    y = "Predicted Total Deaths",
    color = "Disaster Type"
  )

# Convert to interactive plot
ggplotly(plot1, tooltip = "text")

```

#### Approach

The scatter plot was used to compare actual total deaths with predicted total deaths derived from the linear regression model. Insights from the descriptive statistics table informed the model, particularly highlighting the high variability in fatalities for earthquakes (SD = 12845) and the consistent outcomes for floods (SD = 162). Data preprocessing included normalizing variables and filtering to ensure consistent predictions. The key metric for this model was the R-squared value, which demonstrated an accuracy of **85%** in explaining the variability of total deaths across disasters.

#### Key Findings

The scatter plot findings showed that the model performs well across most disaster types, with most points aligning closely with the diagonal line, reflecting accurate predictions for disasters with varying death counts. The consistency observed in the scatter plot aligns with patterns from the descriptive statistics, where disasters like floods and storms, which have lower variability in deaths, showed more tightly clustered predictions.

#### Results

This visualization underscores the predictive power of the model, effectively capturing the relationship between predictors (damages and affected populations) and fatalities. With an R-squared value of 85%, the model demonstrates strong accuracy in predicting total deaths across disaster types. Additionally, the descriptive statistics provided valuable context for the variability in predictions, particularly for disasters with extreme outcomes like earthquakes.

    ),
    yaxis = list(
      title = "Predicted Mean Total Damage (US$)"
    )
  )

# Display the interactive plot
interactive_confidence_plot

```

#### Approach

The confidence interval chart explored variability in predicted mean damages across disaster types by combining insights from a decision tree model and the descriptive statistics table. A bar chart with error bars visually presented the mean damages alongside their confidence intervals. Data preprocessing involved calculating mean damages, standard deviations, and confidence intervals for each disaster type. The key metrics included mean predicted damages, SD damages, and IQR damages derived from the descriptive table.

#### Key Findings

The findings showed that droughts and earthquakes dominate in damages, with the descriptive table indicating that earthquakes have the highest mean damages (\$1.23 million), followed closely by droughts (\$631,000). In contrast, floods and storms showed more consistent outcomes, as their lower standard deviations for damages (floods = \$1.37 million, storms = \$493,000) aligned with narrower confidence intervals in the chart

#### Results

This visualization highlights disaster-specific patterns, where the decision tree analysis revealed that economic losses and disaster type are the primary predictors of damages, supported by the descriptive statistics. While droughts and earthquakes have the highest mean damages, their wide confidence intervals and standard deviations reflect high variability. On the other hand, floods and storms exhibit more predictable impacts, emphasizing the potential role of effective mitigation practices. The combination of descriptive data and visual representation provides a comprehensive understanding of the variability and severity of disaster impacts on infrastructure.

#### Approach

The heatmap aggregates the total affected population by disaster type and region, using logarithmic scaling to handle disparities. Data preprocessing involved handling missing values, filtering for key disaster types (floods, droughts, earthquakes, storms, volcanic activity, and mass movements), and normalizing the "Total Affected" variable. This approach highlights regional patterns and identifies areas with disproportionate impacts.

#### Key Findings

The heatmap revealed that Asia experiences the highest total affected populations, particularly from floods and storms, underscoring heightened vulnerability. Africa faces severe impacts from droughts, while Europe and Oceania report significantly lower numbers, suggesting effective disaster management systems or lower exposure. These patterns highlight the regional disparities in disaster impacts and the need for targeted interventions.

#### Results

The heatmap visualization effectively displayed the regional distribution of disaster impacts. Asia emerged as the most affected region, particularly by floods and storms, highlighting its high vulnerability or exposure to such events. Africa showed significant impacts from droughts, underscoring a critical need for interventions to address these challenges. Europe and Oceania, on the other hand, reported lower total affected populations, potentially due to effective disaster management systems or reduced exposure to severe disasters. This visualization underscores the disparity in disaster impacts across regions and emphasizes the need for targeted disaster management efforts in Asia and Africa

#### Approach

The bar chart evaluates the effectiveness of OFDA responses across disaster types. The percentage change in the average affected population with and without interventions was calculated as the effectiveness metric. Data preprocessing included converting categorical variables into binary indicators (e.g., OFDA responses) and reshaping data for comparative analysis.

#### Key Findings

The bar chart indicated that OFDA responses were most effective for earthquakes, significantly reducing the total affected population. Floods and volcanic activities also showed notable improvements due to interventions, while disasters like mass movements (wet) had limited response impact. Droughts and storms demonstrated moderate effectiveness, suggesting room for improvement in response strategies for these disaster types.

#### Results

The bar chart provided insights into the effectiveness of OFDA responses across various disaster types. Earthquakes demonstrated the highest effectiveness, with significant reductions in total affected populations due to response interventions. Floods and volcanic activities also showed notable improvements, suggesting the positive impact of current intervention strategies. However, disasters like mass movements (wet) exhibited limited response effectiveness, indicating the need for tailored strategies to address specific challenges. Moderate improvements for droughts and storms suggest that while interventions are beneficial, there is scope for enhancing their effectiveness further.

#### Approach

The visualization leverages aggregated disaster data to compare the impacts of floods and earthquakes across the top 20 most affected countries. Total affected populations were used as a key metric to highlight the varying scales of disaster impacts by disaster type and country. A bar chart format with clear differentiation by disaster type ensures easy interpretation of trends.

#### Key Findings

Floods significantly affect larger populations in countries like China and India, with China having the highest overall impact. Earthquakes, while less frequent in this dataset, have notable impacts in countries like Turkey, Chile, and Indonesia. The variation in disaster type impact highlights the differing vulnerabilities and geographic patterns.

#### Results

The visualization underscores the critical need for flood mitigation strategies in populous and flood-prone regions like China and India. Simultaneously, earthquake-affected nations like Turkey and Chile would benefit from strengthened infrastructure and emergency response systems. These insights are essential for developing targeted disaster preparedness and response strategies.

### Approach

To answer the research question, we analyzed the global distribution and impact of floods and earthquakes using HDBSCAN clustering analysis and cluster statistics. The analysis was based on key data variables such as the type of disaster (earthquakes and floods), magnitude (severity of the disaster), total affected (number of people affected by the disaster), total deaths (number of casualties), and total damage (economic loss in USD). Visualizations were used to highlight the geographical distribution of each disaster type and its corresponding impact on different regions. By mapping the disaster data globally and correlating it with the clusters, we focused on analyzing the magnitude, affected population, and economic damage caused by each disaster type.

### Key Findings

**Earthquakes:**\
Earthquakes predominantly affect regions in Asia and the Americas. Countries like Indonesia, Nepal, and parts of China and Japan are heavily impacted by significant earthquake magnitudes such as 7.3 in Asia, with over 28,000 people affected and considerable economic losses. Asia sees the highest frequency of large-magnitude earthquakes (magnitude 7 and above), leading to extensive human and financial tolls.

**Floods:**\
Floods are widespread across regions like Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Countries including India, Bangladesh, Vietnam, and parts of Africa (such as Ethiopia and Nigeria) are severely affected by floods, often caused by storms or excessive rainfall. Flood events are frequent in Africa and Asia, with economic losses ranging from USD 3,244 in some Asian countries to over USD 300,000 in other regions.

**Economic Damage:**\
Earthquakes tend to cause more significant economic damage than floods, with certain regions reporting damages in the hundreds of thousands of USD. Floods in regions like Asia and Africa also cause substantial losses but typically result in lower financial tolls compared to large earthquake events. For instance, Japan and Chile report massive economic losses due to major earthquakes, while Bangladesh and Nigeria, although severely affected by floods, report comparatively lower economic damage.

**Population Affected:**\
Earthquakes generally affect fewer people but tend to result in a higher death toll per disaster. Floods, in contrast, while less deadly in some cases, affect millions globally, especially in regions prone to seasonal rains and storms. Flood-prone regions in Asia, including India, Vietnam, and Bangladesh, consistently show high numbers of affected individuals, whereas earthquake-prone regions such as Indonesia, Nepal, and China report higher fatalities but fewer people affected overall.

### Results

The global distribution of earthquakes and floods demonstrates that Asia and the Americas bear the most significant burden of earthquake activity, while Asia, Africa, and parts of the Americas are particularly affected by floods. Earthquakes cause more severe economic impacts, particularly in regions like Japan and Chile, whereas floods result in widespread population damage but on a smaller financial scale. Countries such as Indonesia, India, Bangladesh, and Nepal are notably vulnerable to both disaster types, experiencing varying degrees of financial damage and loss of life.

Flood-prone regions in Asia consistently show higher numbers of affected people, while earthquake-prone regions report a higher number of fatalities despite fewer people being affected. This analysis emphasizes the need for tailored disaster preparedness strategies in regions vulnerable to both floods and earthquakes. Additionally, the importance of resilient infrastructure in reducing the economic impact of such disasters is highlighted, especially in countries with large populations and high susceptibility to natural hazards.

This approach provides a clear understanding of where the most devastating disasters occur, helping to prioritize resources for more effective disaster management and mitigation efforts in the most impacted regions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Conclusion

-   **Research Question 1 :**

    In conclusion, the analysis reveals significant disparities in how disasters impact human lives and infrastructure. **Earthquakes** are the most catastrophic, with the highest fatalities and economic damages, requiring urgent structural resilience and early warning measures. **Droughts**, while less fatal, affect the largest populations, highlighting the need for long-term water resource management and community support. **Extreme temperatures** pose significant health risks, demanding focused public health interventions, while **floods** and **storms** show more consistent and predictable impacts, reflecting effective disaster management practices. These insights provide a data-driven foundation for prioritizing disaster preparedness, response strategies, and policy interventions to mitigate both human and economic losses.

-   **Research Question 2 :**

    The analysis highlights critical insights into the impact of disaster response measures on mitigating disaster severity. Regions such as Asia and Africa remain highly vulnerable, requiring urgent and targeted interventions to address the challenges posed by **floods, storms**, and **droughts.** Effective disaster response strategies, as evidenced by interventions in **earthquakes** and **floods**, underscore the value of tailored, region-specific approaches. However, the limited effectiveness observed for certain disaster types, like **mass movements (wet)**, calls for further refinement of response measures. This research emphasizes the importance of understanding regional vulnerabilities and disaster-specific challenges to design more impactful and equitable disaster management strategies.

-   **Research Question 3 :**

    ### Conclusion:

    In conclusion, the global distribution of **floods** and **earthquakes** reveals distinct patterns of impact on both populations and economies. **Earthquakes** primarily affect regions in **Asia** and the **Americas**, with significant loss of life and considerable **economic damage**, especially in countries like **Japan**, **Chile**, and **Indonesia**. In contrast, **floods** are more widespread across Asia, Africa, and the Americas, affecting large populations, particularly in countries like **India**, **Bangladesh**, and **Vietnam**. While **floods** may result in fewer fatalities, they have a vast reach, impacting millions and causing substantial economic damage, albeit on a relatively smaller financial scale compared to major earthquakes.

    The analysis underscores the importance of understanding both the **human** and **economic** costs of these natural disasters. **Earthquakes**, while less frequent, tend to cause more severe economic losses, particularly in densely populated regions with inadequate infrastructure. **Floods**, although more frequent and less deadly in some cases, continue to devastate vast areas, displacing millions and leading to significant economic challenges. The findings emphasize the need for targeted **disaster preparedness**, **robust infrastructure**, and resilient systems in disaster-prone regions to mitigate the impacts and reduce both human and financial losses.

    Overall, this research highlights critical areas where intervention and preparedness efforts can be focused, ensuring better **disaster management**, quicker recovery, and long-term resilience in the most vulnerable regions of the world.
