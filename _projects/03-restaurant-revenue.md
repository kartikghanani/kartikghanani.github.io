## Overview
Predict restaurant revenue from business attributes and identify key drivers for optimization.

## What I did
- Engineered a predictive model to forecast restaurant revenue from 17 business attributes by refining a multiple linear regression with interaction terms, boosting its accuracy to an adjusted   R-squared of 0.982. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- Identified key profit drivers for 8,368 restaurants by analysing 17 business attributes, determining with high statistical significance (p < 0.01) that seating capacity and average meal price were the primary influencers for business optimisation. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
