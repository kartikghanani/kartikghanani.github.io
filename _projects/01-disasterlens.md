## Overview
DisasterLens is a global disaster analytics project that forecasts disaster fatalities and groups disasters into meaningful impact clusters.

## What I did
- Achieved predictive accuracy of R² 0.8117 in forecasting worker productivity for an apparel manufacturer by engineering an ensemble Voting Regressor that outperformed 6 other machine learning models, including boosting and tree-based algorithms.  
- Identified underperforming workers by deploying a logistic regression classifier with 75% accuracy, leveraging SHAP and PCA to provide actionable insights on key performance drivers like financial incentives and overtime.

## Tech stack
Python, Scikit-learn, HDBSCAN, Docker, Git/GitHub
