## Overview
DisasterLens is a global disaster analytics project that forecasts disaster fatalities and groups disasters into meaningful impact clusters.

## What I did
- Engineered a predictive model using Python and Scikit-learn to forecast disaster fatalities with 85% accuracy (R² = 0.85), deploying the full project workflow with Docker and version control using Git/GitHub.  
- Applied HDBSCAN clustering and geospatial visualisation to identify 19+ distinct disaster impact clusters globally, providing data-driven policy recommendations for targeted intervention and resource prioritisation.

## Tech stack
Python, Scikit-learn, HDBSCAN, Docker, Git/GitHub
