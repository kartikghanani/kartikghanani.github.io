excerpt: "Predict disaster fatalities (R²=0.85) + cluster global impact patterns using HDBSCAN and geospatial visuals."
order: 1
---

## Overview
DisasterLens analyzes global disaster patterns and forecasts fatalities using machine learning.

## What I Did
- Built a predictive model in **Python + Scikit-learn** to forecast disaster fatalities (**R² = 0.85**).
- Applied **HDBSCAN clustering** and geospatial visualization to identify **19+** distinct impact clusters.
- Packaged the workflow using **Docker** and Git/GitHub.

## Tech Stack
Python, Scikit-learn, HDBSCAN, Plotly/Geo visuals, Docker, Git/GitHub
